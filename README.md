# Comprehensive introduction to **Multi-armed bandits**:  
# *Thompson Sampling*  
# &  
# *Active Learning* in the bandits scenario

===================


This project covers two main topics: the multi-armed bandits theory with extensive 
treatment of the Thompson Sampling approach, as well as the application of multi-armed bandits in active 
learning. The comprehensive introduction to the theory underlying multi-armed 
bandits is gradually developed in the project to cover the concepts necessary for understanding 
the basic bandits strategies. The latter part of the paper presents the first of its 
kind (to the best of our knowledge) application of the Thompson Sampling-inspired multi-armed bandits algorithm 
to solve computer science task of learning in the environment of insufficient 
information.  

Reader does not require any prior knowledge in this field, for only the basics of 
statistics and probability theory are necessary to smoothly follow the text.
