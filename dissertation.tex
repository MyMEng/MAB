\section{Background}

\section{Terminology}
Agent--- a person that decide what arm to pull based on $\tau$ function.
Multi-armed bandit($N$)--- a ``device'' with $N$ possible choices of action.~\cite{berry+firstedt}
Strategy ($\tau$)--- tells the player which arm to pull at given stage of game.
Game--- a sequence of arms pulled based on chosen strategy $\tau$.
Play--- a single arm pull at stage $m$ of the game.

\section{Discount Sequence}
To specify the rules governing the ``significance'' of outcome from a single play at stage $m$ the \emph{discount sequence} is introduced. It is a vector $\mathbf{A}$ of specified length, which can also be infinite.
$$
\mathbf{A} = \left( \alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, ... \right)
$$

\subsection{Most common sequences}
There are many different discount sequences used with multi-armed bandits each with numerous assumptions. In the literature only two of them are described in great detail and both are presented below.
\subsubsection{Uniform sequence}
The $n$-horizon uniform discount sequence is defined as:
\[
 \alpha_i =
  \begin{cases}
   1 & \text{for } i \leq n \\
   0 & \text{for } i > n
  \end{cases}
\]
leading to:
\[
  \mathbf{A} = ( \underbrace{ 1, 1, 1, ..., 1}_{n\text{ elements}}, 0, 0, 0, ... ) \text{ .}
\]
\subsubsection{Geometric sequence}
The geometric discount sequence is expressed with components $\alpha_i = a^{i-1}$ for some $a \in ( 0, 1 )$ resulting in:
$$
\mathbf{A} = \left( a^0, a^1, a^2, ... \right)
$$
where $\alpha_1 = a^0$ is always equal to $1$.
